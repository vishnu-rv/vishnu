### ‚úÖ **Your Points (Correct)**
1. **Jenkins Needs EC2 (Self-Managed Costs):**  
   - You need to provision an **EC2 instance** (or multiple for master-slave architecture).  
   - You pay for uptime **even when idle**.  
   - If the Jenkins server goes down, the **entire pipeline stops**.  

2. **GitHub Actions Is Managed & Serverless:**  
   - Runs on **GitHub-hosted runners**, so no need to manage EC2.  
   - **You only pay per job execution**, not for idle time.  
   - YAML-based, **easier to maintain** compared to complex Jenkinsfiles.  

3. **Cost Considerations:**  
   - **Jenkins:** Requires EC2, storage, networking, and maintenance.  
   - **GitHub Actions:** Charges per minute, but often **cheaper than EC2** unless pipelines run **non-stop**.

### ‚ùó **Industry Standard Comparison (Additional Points)**

| Feature            | Jenkins (Self-Managed)  | GitHub Actions (Cloud) |
|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Hosting**       | Requires EC2, VM, or Kubernetes | Fully managed by GitHub |
| **Cost**          | Pay for EC2 uptime, storage, and networking | Pay per minute (free for small projects) |
| **Reliability**   | Can go down if EC2 fails | Highly available (GitHub Cloud) |
| **Scalability**   | Need to configure worker nodes | Auto-scales |
| **Setup Time**    | More setup & maintenance | Ready-to-use |
| **Security**      | Self-managed, needs updates | GitHub secures infrastructure |
| **Customization** | More plugins, flexible | Limited customization |

### üî• **When to Use What?**
‚úÖ **Use GitHub Actions If:**
- You have a **GitHub-based** project.
- You want a **fully managed**, serverless CI/CD.
- You need **quick pipelines without infrastructure overhead**.

‚úÖ **Use Jenkins If:**
- You need **full control** over pipelines and plugins.
- You want **on-premise** CI/CD (e.g., for security/compliance reasons).
- You are **integrating with multiple tools** beyond GitHub.

---

### **üìå Final:**
- **For startups, small teams, and GitHub-based projects, GitHub Actions is a better choice.**  
- **For enterprises, large-scale pipelines, or custom integrations, Jenkins is still widely used.**  
- Some companies use **both** (Jenkins for complex builds, GitHub Actions for simple deployments).
