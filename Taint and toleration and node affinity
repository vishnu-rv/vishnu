Let's break this down step by step to clarify the concepts:

---

### **Testing Pods Without Tolerations for Tainted Nodes**

- If a **node** has a **taint**, pods **without a matching toleration** will **not** be scheduled on that node.
- **Example**:  
  A node has this taint:  
  ```bash
  kubectl taint nodes node1 key=test:NoSchedule
  ```  
  If you create a pod without a toleration for `key=test`, the pod will remain unscheduled.

**Key Takeaway**:  
- For **taints** and **tolerations**, the pod **must have the exact toleration** to be placed on the tainted node.
- **Testing pods without tolerations cannot be scheduled on tainted nodes.**

---

### **Node Affinity Behavior**

1. **Node Affinity Works on Labels**:
   - Node Affinity uses **labels** on nodes to schedule pods.
   - For a pod to be scheduled using **RequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution**, the node **must match the specified labels**.

   **Example**:  
   Label a node:  
   ```bash
   kubectl label nodes node1 env=testing
   ```  
   Pod with Node Affinity:  
   ```yaml
   affinity:
     nodeAffinity:
       requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
         nodeSelectorTerms:
         - matchExpressions:
           - key: "env"
             operator: "In"
             values:
             - "testing"
   ```

   This pod **will only be scheduled on nodes with the label `env=testing`**.

2. **Behavior When No Nodes Match**:
   - With `RequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`:  
     If no nodes match, the pod will **not be scheduled**.
   - With `PreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`:  
     If no nodes match, Kubernetes will try to schedule the pod on any available node as a **fallback**.

---

### **"Ignore During Scheduling" in Node Affinity**

- The phrase "IgnoredDuringExecution" means **node affinity rules are only considered at scheduling time**.
- Once a pod is running, even if the node’s labels change and no longer match the affinity rules, the pod **will not be evicted**.

**Example**:  
1. A pod is scheduled on a node labeled `env=testing`.  
2. Later, the label `env=testing` is removed from the node.  
   - The pod will continue running without being evicted, as the rule is "ignored during execution."

---

### **How Node Affinity Differs from Taints**

- **Node Affinity**:  
  - Controls **where pods should run** based on labels.  
  - Flexible with "preferred" rules, and strict with "required" rules.  

- **Taints**:  
  - Explicitly **repel** pods unless they "tolerate" the taint.  
  - Works as a hard constraint.

---

### **Answering Your Scenario**
- **Testing Pods with No Toleration**:  
  - Cannot run on a tainted node unless a toleration is explicitly provided.  
  - Taints are strict and block scheduling.  

- **Node Affinity with No Matching Nodes**:  
  - If using `RequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`, the pod won’t be scheduled.  
  - If using `PreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`, the pod can still run on other available nodes, even if no matching labels are found.
